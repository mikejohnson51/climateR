`climateR` simplifies the steps needed to get gridded geospatial data
into R. At its core, it provides three main things:

1.  A catalog of 112398 geospatial climate, land cover, and soils
    resources from 3477 collections. See (`climateR::catalog`)

This catalog is an [evolving, federated collection of
datasets](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/climateR-catalogs) that can
be accessed by the data access utilities. This resource is rebuilt
automatically on a monthly cycle to ensure the data provided is
accurate, while continuously growing based on user requests.

2.  A general [toolkit for accessing remote and local gridded
    data](https://mikejohnson51.github.io/climateR/reference/index.html#data-access)
    files bounded by space, time, and variable constraints (`dap`,
    `dap_crop`, `read_dap_file`)

3.  A set of
    [shortcuts](https://mikejohnson51.github.io/climateR/reference/index.html#shortcuts)
    that implement these methods for a core set of selected catalog
    elements

> :warning: **Python Users**: Data catalog access is available through
> the USGS [`gdptools`](https://gdptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
> package. Directly analogous climateR functionality can be found in
> [`climatePy`](https://github.com/LynkerIntel/climatePy)

# Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("mikejohnson51/AOI") # suggested!
remotes::install_github("mikejohnson51/climateR")
```

``` r
library(climateR)
```

# Basic Usage

The examples used here call upon the following shortcuts:

- `getGridMET` (OPeNDAP server, historic data)
- `getMODIS` (Authenticated OPeNDAP server)
- `getMACA` (OPeNDAP server, projection data)
- `getNLCD` (COG)
- `get3DEP` (VRT)
- `getCHIRPS` (erddap)

With the aim of highlighting the convenience of a consistent access
patterns for a variety of data stores.

### Defining Areas/Points of Interest

`climateR` is designed with the same concepts as `AOI`. Namely, that all
spatial data aggregation questions must start with an extent/area of
interest.

Before extracting any data, you must provide an. For the examples here,
we will use the state of Colorado (polygons), and all of its cities
(points).

``` r
colorado = aoi_get(state = "CO", county = "all")

cities = readRDS(system.file("co/cities_colorado.rds", package = "climateR"))
```

## Extent extraction

The default behavior of `climateR` is to request data for the extent of
the AOI passed regardless of whether it is `POINT` or `POLYGON` data.

The *exception* to the default behavior is if the the AOI is a single
point. To illustrate:

#### POLYGON(s) act as a single extent

``` r
# Request Data for Colorado (POLYGON(s))
system.time({
  gridmet_pr = getGridMET(AOI = colorado,
                 varname = "pr",
                 startDate = "1991-10-29",
                 endDate  = "1991-11-06")
})
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.195   0.021   1.266
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.jpeg" width="100%" />

#### POINTS(s) act as a single extent

``` r
# Request data using cities (POINTs)
pr = getGridMET(
    AOI       = cities,
    varname   = "pr",
    startDate = "2020-10-29")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.jpeg" width="100%" />

#### Single POINT(s) act as an extent

However since the extent of a POINT means `{xmax = xmin}` and
`{ymax = ymin}`, climateR will return a time series of the intersecting
cell, opposed to a one cell `SpatRaster`.

``` r
# Request data for a single city
system.time({
  future_city = getMACA(AOI = cities[1,],
                        varname = "tasmax",
                        startDate = "2050-10-29",
                        endDate  = "2050-11-06")
})
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.203   0.005   0.547
```

``` r
future_city
#>         date tasmax_CCSM4_r6i1p1_rcp45
#> 1 2050-10-29                  295.7503
#> 2 2050-10-30                  292.0839
#> 3 2050-10-31                  289.6805
#> 4 2050-11-01                  287.1293
#> 5 2050-11-02                  290.7788
#> 6 2050-11-03                  287.1146
#> 7 2050-11-04                  290.1259
#> 8 2050-11-05                  291.0247
#> 9 2050-11-06                  291.6172
```

#### Dynamic AOIs, tidyverse piping

All `climateR` functions treat the extent of the AOI and the default
extraction area. This allows multiple climateR shortcuts to be chained
together using either the base R or dplyr piping syntax.

``` r
pipes = aoi_ext("Fort Collins", wh = c(10, 20), units = "km", bbox = TRUE)|>
  getNLCD() |>
  getTerraClimNormals(varname = c("tmax", "ppt"))

lapply(pipes, dim)
#> $`2019 Land Cover L48`
#> [1] 1402  786    1
#> 
#> $tmax
#> [1] 10  8 12
#> 
#> $ppt
#> [1] 10  8 12
```

### Extract timeseries from exisitng objects:

Using `extract_sites`, you can pass an existing data object. If no
identified column is provided to name the extracted timeseries, the
first, fully unique column in the data.frame is used:

``` r
gridmet_pts = extract_sites(gridmet_pr, pts = cities)
names(gridmet_pts)[1:5]
#> [1] "date" "177"  "283"  "527"  "117"

gridmet_pts = extract_sites(gridmet_pr, pts = cities, ID = 'NAME')
names(gridmet_pts)[1:5]
#> [1] "date"      "ADAMSCITY" "AGATE"     "AGUILAR"   "AKRON"
```

# Unit Based Extraction

While the default behavior is to extract data by **extent**, there are
cases when the input AOI is a set of discrete units that you *want* to
act as discrete units.

- A set of `POINT`s from which to extract time series
- A set of `POLYGON`s that data should be summarized to (mean, max, min,
  etc.) (**WIP**)

In `climateR`, populating the `ID` parameter of any shortcut (or `dap`)
function, triggers data to be extracted by unit.

### Extact timeseries for POINTs

In the `cities` object, the individual `POINT`s are uniquely identified
by a `NAME` column. Tellings a climateR function, that `ID = "NAME"`
triggers it to return the summary:

``` r
chirps_pts = getCHIRPS(AOI = cities,
                       varname = "precip",
                       startDate = "1991-10-29",
                       endDate  = "1991-11-06",
                       ID = "NAME")

dim(chirps_pts)
#> [1]   9 584
names(chirps_pts)[1:5]
#> [1] "date"      "ADAMSCITY" "AGATE"     "AGUILAR"   "AKRON"
```

### Integration with `zonal`

While climateR does not yet provide areal summaries, our intention is to
integrate the functionality from `zonal`. Until then, `climateR` outputs
can be piped directly into `execute_zonal`. The zonal package also
requires a uniquely identifying column name, and a function to summarize
data with.

``` r
library(zonal)

system.time({
  chirps = getCHIRPS(AOI = colorado,
               varname = "precip",
               startDate = "1991-10-29",
               endDate  = "1991-11-06") %>% 
           execute_zonal(geom = colorado, 
                         fun = "max", 
                         ID = "fip_code")
})
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.174   0.012   1.245
```
