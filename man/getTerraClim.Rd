\title{Get Terra Climate Data for an Area of Interest}
\usage{
getTerraClim(AOI, param, startDate, endDate = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{AOI}{a spatial polygon object (sf or sp)}

\item{param}{a meterological parameter (see `param_meta$terraclim`)}

\item{startDate}{a start date given as "YYYY-MM-DD"}

\item{endDate}{an end date given as "YYYY-MM-DD"}
}
\value{
if AOI is an areal extent a list of rasterStacks, if AOI is a point then a data.frame of modeled records.
}
\description{
TerraClim a dataset of high-spatial resolution (1/24Â°, ~4-km) monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958-2015.
These data were created by using climatically aided interpolation, combining high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the WorldClim version 1.4 and version 2 datasets, with coarser resolution time varying (i.e. monthly) data from CRU Ts4.0 and JRA-55
to produce a monthly dataset of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure, and solar radiation. TerraClimate additionally produces monthly surface water balance datasets using a water balance model that incorporates reference
evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature, and interpolated plant extractable soil water capacity.
